# VIP Platform - Stellar Blockchain

**A scalable Web3 backend infrastructure for exclusive luxury communities, built on the Stellar network and Soroban smart contracts.**

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the core blockchain infrastructure for a VIP platform that enables luxury brands to create exclusive, Web3-powered communities for their top clients. The system leverages Stellar's speed, low cost, and built-in compliance features to manage digital assets (NFTs) and reward member engagement seamlessly.

The initial implementation is tailored for a yacht manufacturer's community but is architecturally designed for scalability to any luxury brand (e.g., automotive, fashion, real estate).

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Custodial Wallet Service:** Automated, seamless creation and management of user wallets. Members never see private keys or pay gas fees.
*   **NFT Badge System:** Issuance of verifiable achievement badges (as Stellar-Class assets) to reward member activities and status.
*   **Multi-Signature Treasury:** Secure, corporate-grade management of platform assets with defined governance controls.
*   **Soroban Smart Contracts:** Rust-based contracts for minting and managing unique NFTs and future logic.
*   **Compliance-Ready Architecture:** Native support for authorized assets, enabling KYC/AML whitelisting for regulated future assets.

## üìã Project Backlog & Roadmap

The development is prioritized into phases and tracked via GitHub Projects and Issues.

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current Focus)
*   **`epic: infrastructure`**: Setup of master and treasury accounts, asset issuance, and the custodial wallet service.
*   **`epic: smart-contracts`**: Development and deployment of the Soroban-based NFT minting contract.

### Phase 2: Integration & Engagement
*   **`epic: integration`**: Connecting the admin dashboard to the blockchain for badge distribution and real-time UI updates.
*   **`epic: compliance`**: Implementing whitelisting and trustline management for future regulated assets.

### Phase 3: Multi-Brand Scalability
*   Onboarding workflows for new luxury brands to launch their own independent communities on the platform.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   `rustc` + `cargo` (for Soroban contracts)
*   `stellar-core` / `stellar-cli`
*   `docker` (for optional containerized DB/KMS)
*   Node.js or Python (for backend, TBD)

### Installation & Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/vip-platform-stellar-backend.git
    cd vip-platform-stellar-backend
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Copy the example environment file and configure your keys and endpoints.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your details:
    # - STELLAR_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY=
    # - STELLAR_MASTER_PRIVATE_KEY= (FOR TESTNETS ONLY - use env vars, never commit)
    # - STELLAR_TREASURY_PUBLIC_KEY=
    # - STELLAR_NETWORK="FUTURENET"
    # - DATABASE_URL=
    # - KMS_CONFIG=
    ```

3.  **Fund Accounts and Deploy (Futurenet)**
    Run the initial setup script to configure accounts and deploy the core NFT asset.
    ```bash
    ./scripts/init-futurenet.sh
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Service**
    ```bash
    # Example (Node.js)
    npm install
    npm run dev

    # Or with Docker
    docker-compose up
    ```

## üîß Usage

### For Administrators
*   **Grant a Badge:** Use the admin API endpoint `POST /api/internal/mint-badge` to award an NFT to a user. The system handles signing and submitting the transaction to the Stellar network.
*   **View Metrics:** Access the dashboard to see total members, NFTs distributed, and community activity.

### For Developers
*   **Interact with Contracts:** Use the Soroban CLI or SDK to call contract functions.
    ```bash
    soroban contract invoke \
        --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
        --source <TREASURY_ACCOUNT> \
        --network futurenet \
        -- \
        mint \
        --to <MEMBER_ADDRESS> \
        --badge_id 123
    ```
